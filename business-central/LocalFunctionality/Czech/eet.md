## How it Works in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]

The following sales documents are covered in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]:

- Sales invoice payment

- Cash desk receipt for sales to the G/L account (without source sales document)  

With posting of defined documents (and with defined payment method) is created EET ledger entry and based on the functionality regime is processed:

- Online – An EET entry is created and stored in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]. A message to the tax authorities is generated and sent to the server. An answer from the server is processed and stored and on the customer’s receipt is printed a unique transaction ID generated by tax authorities.  
- Off-line - An EET entry is created and stored in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]. On the customer’s receipt is printed a unique ID generated in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] (identification of company and document). EET records are processed later by batch job.
