# Sales VAT Advance Notifications  
A Sales VAT Advance Notification in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] is an XML file that you can use to report VAT to the German tax authorities on the Elektronische SteuererklÃ¤rungen (ELSTER) online portal. The XML file includes tax and base amounts, and information about your company, and is created in the format and layout that German tax authorities require.    

> [!NOTE]
 >  Most of the functionality is included in the **ELSTER VAT Localization for Germany** Extension. Make sure that this is installed in your [!INCLUDE [prodshort](../../includes/prodshort.md)].
