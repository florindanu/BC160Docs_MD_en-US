# Petty Cash Management

The petty cash management feature enables you to:

- Create multiple cash account cards.
- Create ingoing and outgoing cash order documents with the following specifications:
  - Number them using special numbering rules.
  - Create printing windows of the documents in the required format.
  - Post the documents.
- Void posted cash documents (checks).
- Print the following required reports:
  - Cash Order Journal CO-3
  - Cash Report CO-4.

## Cash Order Journal

To use the ingoing cash order feature, create one general journal template with the Cash Order Payment type. There can be several cash accounts in the company, and several cash points (for example cashiers) for each cash account. For each cash account, you must create a cash account with the Cash Account Card feature.

For each cash point, create a General Journal batch. The value of the **Balance Account Type** field of the batch line should be chosen as Bank Account, and the appropriate cash account should be entered in the **Balance Account Number** field.

The following procedure shows how to access the **Cash Order Journal** window.

- In **Financial Management**, choose **Cash Management**, and then choose **Cash Order Journal**.

  To create a new  cash order, or to work with an existing unposted cash order, choose the correct batch name (and accordingly the cash point). This field is required and matches the **Batch Name** field in financial journals. The **Cash Order Journal** window contains the fields listed in the following table.

| Field                 | Description                                                  |
