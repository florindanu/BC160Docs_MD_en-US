# Set Up Customer Prepayments

Prepayments are advance payments on sales orders that are received, invoiced, and posted before the final invoice is issued. For example, you may require a deposit before you manufacture and ship an item to a customer. Prepayments let you invoice and collect advance payments from customers and post the payments against the correct invoices and accounts.
