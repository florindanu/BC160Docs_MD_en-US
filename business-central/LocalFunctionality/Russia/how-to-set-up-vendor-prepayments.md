# Set Up Vendor Prepayments

Prepayments are advance payments on purchase orders that are paid before the final invoice is issued. For example, you may be required by a vendor to prepay 20 percent of the invoice amount on a manufactured item. Prepayments allow you track and record advance payments on purchase invoices.
