# Set Up Customer and Vendor Agreements

The customer and vendor agreements feature provides the following:

- A list of agreements for customers and vendors
- An agreement card where all the required information about agreements is stored
- Synchronization between agreements and dimensions, to enable use of existing reports and dimension analyses

The following procedure shows how to set up an agreement for a customer, but the procedure for a vendor is similar and starts from the **Purchases & Payables** window.

## To set up an agreement

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Sales & Receivables Setup**, and then choose the related link.
