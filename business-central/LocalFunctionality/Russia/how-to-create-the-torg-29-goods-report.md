# Create the TORG-29 Goods Report

The TORG-29 report shows the item documents that you can use to submit for receipts and shipments for a location.  

When you run the report for a location, the **Last Goods Report No.** and **Last Goods Report Date** fields in the **Location Card** window are updated to ensure consistent reporting.
