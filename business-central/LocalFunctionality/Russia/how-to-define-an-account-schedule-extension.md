# Define an Account Schedule Extension

[!INCLUDE[prodshort](../../includes/prodshort.md)] enables you to define an extension for an account schedule line. Extensions are useful if you want to filter the data of your general ledger accounts.

## To define an account schedule extension

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Account Schedule**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the account schedule for which you want to define an extension.
3. Select **Edit account schedule**.
4. In the **Row No.** field, select the number of the account schedule row for which you want to define an extension.
5. In the **Totaling Type** field, select **Custom**, and then select the table that you want to use from the **Extension Source Table** field.

Based on your selections, the account schedule information is filtered from the entry tables, and then new amounts are calculated for the specified account schedule line.
