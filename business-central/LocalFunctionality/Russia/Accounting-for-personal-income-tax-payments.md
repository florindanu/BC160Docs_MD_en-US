# Accounting for Personal Income Tax Payments

The Fund for the calculation and payment of personal income tax must be registered in the system as a supplier-tax authority.

Personal income tax calculations can be divided into three parts:

- Accrual of tax;
- Payment of taxes;
- Formation of mandatory reporting.

Calculation of the amount of personal income tax is carried out automatically at the time of the main payroll for each employee.

At the time of accounting of the salary document, the formation of operations of debt on personal income tax for each employee in correspondence with the specified code of the supplier of the tax authority and the corresponding operations in the Ledger is carried out.

Personal income tax is paid by forming a payment order to the tax authority.
