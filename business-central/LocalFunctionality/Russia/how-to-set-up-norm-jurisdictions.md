# Set Up Norm Jurisdictions

Norm jurisdictions are based on Russian tax laws that define a variety of tax rates. Norm jurisdictions are used to calculate taxable profits and losses in tax accounting. You can use the **Norm Jurisdictions** window to set up and define norm jurisdictions that can be used when you calculate tax differences.
