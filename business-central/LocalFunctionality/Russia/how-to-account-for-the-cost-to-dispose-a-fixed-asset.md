# Account for the Cost to Dispose a Fixed Asset

The maintenance on disposal feature enables you to account for the amount spent to dispose a fixed asset (FA) as an expense. You can post operations related to spending for the disposal of a fixed asset so that they will be reflected in the FA Write-Off Act forms. 

The expenses of a fixed asset disposal can be posted from general ledger journals, fixed asset journals, and purchase documents. The following procedure shows how to post the expenses for a fixed asset disposal by using the Fixed Asset General Ledger Journal. 

The expenses on a fixed asset disposal can be printed in the FA Write-off Act FA-4 report and the FA Writeoff Act FA-4a report.

## To set up a maintenance code

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature](../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **FA Setup**, and then choose the related link.
2. In the **Fixed Asset Setup** window, on the **General** FastTab, enter a maintenance code in the **On Disposal Maintenance Code** field.
