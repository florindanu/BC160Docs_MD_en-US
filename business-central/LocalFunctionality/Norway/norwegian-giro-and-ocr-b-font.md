# Norwegian Giro and OCR-B Font
A General Interbank Recurring Order (giro) is a payment system that operates like a credit transfer.  

The last line on the giro uses the OCR-B font. This is required by Bankenes Betalingssentral (BBS) for use with optical character recognition (OCR) when handling payments from customers. For more information, see the [Brukehåndbok Indbetalingstjeneste (NO).pdf](https://www.nets.eu/no-nb/SiteCollectionDocuments/Egiro/Brukehåndbok%20Innbetalingstjenestene%20(NO).pdf) on the NETS.eu website.  

The OCR-B-10 BT font is generally available from software vendors. In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], Norwegian sales documents use the OCR-B-10 BT font from BitStream Inc. on the giro. For more information, see the fonts.com website at [OCR-B-10 BT](https://www.fonts.com/font/bitstream/ocr-b-bt/10).  

You can use any OCR-B font, but if other fonts are used, the sales documents must be updated by a Microsoft Certified Partner. Contact your partner for more information.
