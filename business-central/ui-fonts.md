# Available Fonts
The online version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] contains pre-installed fonts on the servers that can be used when generating reports. The following outlines which fonts are available and has links to detailed information at the 3rd-party suppliers of the fonts.

> [!NOTE]
> For security and legal reasons, you cannot upload custom fonts to the [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] environment.

## Check (MICR and Security) Fonts  
Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) fonts are installed and available to use. Both the E-13B and the CMC-7 standards are supported. In addition to MICR fonts, special security fonts are available to generate text, names, amounts, and the currency symbols Dollar, Euro, Pound, and Yen, which are hard to tamper with once a check has been printed. For more information, see [Select a Check Layout](finance-how-define-check-layouts.md).
