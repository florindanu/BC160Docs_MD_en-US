# How the Post Code and City Fields Are Filled
If you fill in **Post Code** field with a post code that is linked to a single city in the **Post Code** table, ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]--> displays a list of the relevant cities for you to choose from. If the post code is not set up in the **Post Code** table, you must enter the city manually.  
  
 If you fill in the **City** field before the **Post Code** field, and if the city is linked to a single post code in the **Post Code** table, ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]--> displays a list of post codes for you to choose from. If the city is not set up in the **Post Code** table, you must enter the post code manually.
