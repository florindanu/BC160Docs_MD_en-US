# View Test Reports Before Posting
When you are ready to post a document, such as an order, invoice, or a credit memo, you can test the document to ensure that no issues exist that will block the posting.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The following procedure is about testing before posting a purchase document. The functionality works in the same way for sales documents.  
  
### To print a test report before posting a purchase invoice  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Purchase Invoices**, and then select the related link.  
  
2.  Open the purchase invoice that you want to test.  
  
3.  On the **Actions** tab, in the **Posting** group, choose **Test Report**.  
  
     All parts of the purchase invoice are tested, and the result is presented in a report. If the report indicates any errors or missing information, then you must correct the problem before posting the purchase invoice.
