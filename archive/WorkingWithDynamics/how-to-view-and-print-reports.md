# View and Print Reports
In Business Central, there are many predefined reports that you can find in different ways:  

In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)], there are many predefined reports that you can find in different ways:  

-   Some pages contain a **Reports** menu with reports related to the page, and reports may also be accessed from the ribbon.  

-   You can find reports for each department in the **Departments** menu.  

-   When you post a document, you have the option to print the document at the same time as you post the document.  

### To define a report  

1.  Open the relevant report.  

2.  If there is an **Options** FastTab for the report, fill in the fields on the **Options** FastTab to determine what is displayed in the report.  

     To see Help for the report, press F1 in the report request window. The Help will explain how to fill in any option fields in the window.  

3.  If you want to limit the data that is included in the report, you can set filters. You can enter criteria in the suggested filters or add more filters.  

     There is a FastTab for each table that is used in the report. There may be two types of filters available for each table:  

    -   Under the **Show results** heading, you can enter table filters.  

    -   Under the **Limit totals to** heading, you can enter FlowFilters.  

     For more information, see [Set Filters](../FullExperience/enter-criteria-in-filters.md).  

## Sorting Data  
 Some reports let you control the sort order of the data in the report. If the report contains a **Sorting** section in one of the FastTabs with filters, you can sort records in ascending or descending order, for example, numerically or alphabetically.  

#### To sort data in the report  

1.  In the **Sorting** section of the report request window, use the first drop-down arrow to select the relevant field.  

2.  Use the second drop-down arrow to select **Sort ascending** or **Sort descending**.  

### To preview a report  

-   If you want to see the report on the screen before printing, choose the **Preview** button.  

### To modify the page setup  

-   You can specify the paper size or orientation, or the margins for a report. In the **Print Preview** window, choose **Page Setup**![Page Setup icon](../FullExperience/media/pagesetup.png "pageSetup"). Modify the settings in the **Page Setup** window.  

### To print the report  

-   To print the report, choose the **Print** button, either in the **Print Preview** window or in the report request window. If you do not want to print the report now, choose the **Cancel** button to close the window.  

     If you choose **Print** from the report request window, the **Print** window opens and you can select a printer and enter details about how the printing will be done.  

## Saving the Report  
 You can open reports in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel, and you can save the documents. You can also save reports as PDF documents.  

 For more information, see [Integrating with Microsoft Office](../FullExperience/integrating-with-microsoft-office.md).  

#### To save or open the report  

1.  In the report request window, choose the **Print** button, and then choose **PDF**, **Microsoft Word**, or **Microsoft Excel**.  

2.  In the window that appears, choose to open or save the document.  

#### To save as a PDF, Word, or Excel file from the Print Preview Window  

-   From the **Print Preview** window, you can save the report as a PDF file, a Word file, or an Excel worksheet. To do so, choose **Save As**![Save icon](../FullExperience/media/save.gif "save"), and then choose **PDF**, **Word**, or **Excel**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Printing is restricted on certain reports, such as posted sales and purchase documents. Therefore, the **Print Preview** window for these documents does not contain a **Save As ![Save icon](../FullExperience/media/printicon.png "printIcon")** button.
