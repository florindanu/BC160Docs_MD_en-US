# Add a Note to a Record and Share It with Other Users
The ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[navnow](../../includes/rtc_md.md)]--> enables you to attach a note to any record, such as a document or card. For example, if you have extra information about a sales order that does not belong in any of the fields on the sales order page, you can write it in a note. This note will be visible on the sales order for you and any of your colleagues who view the sales order.  
  
 You can set the note to display as a notification in your colleague's Role Center, or on your own Role Center as a reminder.  
  
 You can read the note in **My Notifications** and then double-click it to open the sales order.  
  
 You cannot delete notes in **My Notifications**. Instead, you must open the record that the note is attached to, and delete it there, but only if you have been allocated the necessary permissions.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.
