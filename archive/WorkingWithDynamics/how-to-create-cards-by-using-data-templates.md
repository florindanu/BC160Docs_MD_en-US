# Create Cards by Using Data Templates
Cards hold master data that represent business accounts such as items, vendors, and customers. For example, an item card displays the necessary information to store, maintain, and trade the item.  
  
 Each card can be based on a data template, which has different characteristics of a business account. For example, item cards can be based on a Wholesale template or a Production template.  
  
### To create a card using a data template  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Items**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, choose **New** to create a new empty item card.  
  
3.  Leave the **No.** field empty to automatically insert a number from the item card number series.  
  
4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Process** group, choose **Apply Template**.  
  
5.  In the **Data Template List** window, select a template, such as Wholesale Item, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 The fields on the item card are now filled with the default template values. You can now make any necessary edits.
