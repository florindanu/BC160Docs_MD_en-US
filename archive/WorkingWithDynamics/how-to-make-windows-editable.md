Business Central lets you work with windows in three different modes: View, Edit, and New. The mode appears in the window caption, before the window name. For example, **View - Customer Card - 10000 The Cannon Group PLC**.

### To edit a card or document  

-   If you are in a card or document window in view mode and want to edit data in the window:  

     On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  

-   If you are in a list window and want to open one record from the list:  

     Select the line with the record that you want to edit, on the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit**.  

### To edit a list  

-   Some lists can be made editable, such as the **Currencies** list, or the **General Posting Setup** window. To switch a list to edit mode:  

     On the **Home** tab, in the **Manage** group, choose **Edit List**.  

 You can now edit data on an existing line or insert a new line.
