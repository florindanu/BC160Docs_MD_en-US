# Mandatory Fields
When you enter data on pages in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]-->, certain fields are marked with a red asterisk. The red asterisk means that the field must be filled to complete a certain process that uses the field, such as posting a transaction that uses the value in the field.  
  
 Even though the field contains a red asterisk, you are not forced to fill the field before you continue to other fields or close the page. The red asterisk only serves as a reminder that you will be blocked from completing a certain process.  
  
## Examples  
 In the **Customer Card** window, the red asterisk appears in the **Name** field and in the three posting group fields to indicate that you cannot post a sales transaction for the customer unless the fields are filled.  
  
 In the **Item Card** window, the red asterisk appears in the **Description** and the **Base Unit of Measure** fields to indicate that you cannot enter the item on a document line, such as a sales order, unless the fields are filled.
