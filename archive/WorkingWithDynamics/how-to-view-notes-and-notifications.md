# View Notes and Notifications
Business Central enables you and your colleagues to attach notes to records in the application. For example, if your colleague wants to give you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the fields on the sales order page, they can write a note and send it to you as a notification on your Role Center.  

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] enables you and your colleagues to attach notes to records in the application. For example, if your colleague wants to give you extra information about a sales order that is not covered by the fields on the sales order page, they can write a note and send it to you as a notification on your Role Center.  

When you read the notification on your Role Center, you can open the sales order just by double-clicking the note.  

### To open a record from a notification  

-   On the Role Center, in **My Notifications**, choose the notification.  

     The document that the notification is attached to, such as a customer card or sales order opens.  

### To view the full text of a notification  

1.  On the Role Center, in **My Notifications**, select the notification that you want to read.  

2.  In the shortcut menu, choose **View**.  

 A window opens to display the full text of the note.  

### To view the full text of a note on a task page  

1.  Open the record that the note is attached to, for example a customer card or sales order. If the note is attached to a line, such as a journal line, select the relevant line.  

2.  If **Notes** is not visible on the page, you can customize the page to display the Notes Factbox. For more information, see [Customize the User Interface](../FullExperience/customize-the-user-interface.md).  

3.  In **Notes**, choose the note that you want to read.  

 A window opens to display the full text of the note.
