# Entering Negative Numbers
You can enter negative numbers in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]--> in two ways. The number -20.5 can be entered as:  
  
-   -20.5  
  
-   20.5-  
  
 In both cases, the amount will be recorded in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]--> as -20.5.  
  
 If the last character of the expression is a **+** or a **-**, the entire expression will be recorded with that sign. An example, **10-20+** will result in 10 and not -10.
