# See Which Report Layouts are Used on Reports
You can see which report layouts are used on Business Central reports from the **Report Layout Selection** window. From this window, you can change layout that is used on a report, create new custom layouts, or make variations of existing custom layouts.  

You can see which report layouts are used on [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] reports from the **Report Layout Selection** window. From this window, you can change layout that is used on a report, create new custom layouts, or make variations of existing custom layouts.  

### To see the report layouts are set up on reports  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Report Layout Selection**, and then choose the related link.  

     The window lists all the reports that are available for the company that is set in the **Company** field at the top of the window.  

     The **Selected Layout** and **Report Description** fields indicate the layout that is currently used on the report.  

2.  To see the report layouts for another company, change the **Company** field.
