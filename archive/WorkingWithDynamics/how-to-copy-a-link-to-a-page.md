# Copy a Link to a Page
All pages have a **Copy Link to Page** action that you can use to save a link to a specific page in ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]-->. You can then share these pages across your company. The link text is the same as the page header text.  

> [!WARNING]  
>  Some page links are longer than 255 characters, which is the maximum length for the Windows **Run** menu. A link longer than 255 characters cannot be run from the **Run** menu.  

### To copy a link to the Customers window  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Customers**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  In the **Application** menu, choose **Page**, and then choose **Copy Link to Page**.  

3.  Open a text editor such as Notepad, and then create a new document.  

4.  Paste the copied link in the new document.  

 If your text editor supports clickable hyperlinks, then the text of the pasted link is **Customers**. Select the link to open ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)]-->. The **Customers** window opens in a separate window.  

 If your text editor does not support clickable hyperlinks, then the text of the pasted link is the URL to the **Customers** page.
