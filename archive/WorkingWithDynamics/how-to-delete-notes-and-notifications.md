# Delete Notes and Notifications
You cannot delete a notification on the Role Center; you must delete the note on the record where it was created. You can only delete a note if your administrator has assigned the necessary user permissions to you.  
  
### To delete a note  
  
1.  Open the record that the note is attached to, such as a customer card or sales order. If the note is attached to a line, such as a journal line, select the relevant line.  
  
2.  If **Notes** is not visible on the page, go to the **Application** menu, and choose **Customize**, and then choose **Customize This Page** to display the **Notes** FactBox.  
  
3.  In **Notes**, select the note that you want to delete, choose **Actions**![Action Menu icon](../FullExperience/media/actionmenuicon.png "actionMenuIcon"), and then choose **Delete**.
