# Use Find-Go to
In Business Central you can search in data by using the **Find** mechanism. Find searches on all types of pages that have data, except in chart pages. You specify the field you want to search in and the string you want to search for. Find is also available from the action strip.  

In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](../../includes/d365fin_md.md)] you can search in data by using the **Find** mechanism. Find searches on all types of pages that have data, except in chart pages. You specify the field you want to search in and the string you want to search for. Find is also available from the action strip.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  On card pages the same type of Find functionality is also available, but due to the nature of cards, the functionality is named Go to. You use **Find** and **Go to** in the exact same way.  

 The following example shows how to use Find to search for data on the **Sales Order** page.  

### To use Find  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Sales Orders**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  On the **Actions** tab, choose **Find**.  

3.  In the **Find in Sales Header** window, select the row that you want to search for a specific string or data in.  

4.  In the **matches** field, enter the string or number that you want to search for. Choose **Find Next** to start the search.  

5.  Use the **Find Next** and **Find Previous** buttons to search through rows. Toggle between the list and the Find window to make edits and continue searching.  

    > [!TIP]  
    >  Use Enter to find the next row. Use Shift+Enter to find the previous row.  

6.  Choose the **Close** button when you have finished searching.
