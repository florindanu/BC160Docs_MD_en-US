# Searching for Data
In the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_web](../../includes/nav_phone_md.md)]-->, you can use the Search functionality to limit a data set across columns on lists. Search is enabled by entering criteria in search box. The search is cleared by selecting the cross next to the search box.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  In ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]--> you have a **Quick Filter** capability that works in a similar manner as Search.  
  
 The following table illustrates some Search text examples:  
  
|Search Criteria|Interpreted as…|Returns…|  
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|  
|man|@*man*|All records that contain the text **man** and case insensitive.|  
|se|@*se*|All records that contain the text **se** and case insensitive.|  
|Man*|Starts with Man and case sensitive|All records that start with the text **Man**.|  
|'man'|An exact text and case sensitive|All records that match **man** exactly.|  
|@*man|Ends with and case insensitive|All records that end with **man**.|  
|@man*|Starts with and case insensitive|All records that start with **man**.|
