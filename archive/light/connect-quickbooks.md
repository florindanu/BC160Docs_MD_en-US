# Use [!INCLUDE[d365inv_long](includes/d365inv_long.md)] with Intuit QuickBooks

You're using [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] to create and send estimates and invoices to your customers, but you might want to use another system to handle your purchases, inventory, or bookkeeping. If you're using Intuit QuickBooks, you can connect to [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)]. QuickBooks becomes the backend system for [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], and your customers and inventory items are synchronized seamlessly between the two apps. Your invoices are synchronized from [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] to QuickBooks but not the other way around.  

Products are the basis of your business, the goods or services that you trade in. Each product must be registered as an item in the Prices list. An item holds the information that is required to buy, store, sell, deliver, and account for products you sell.  

To connect your [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] to QuickBooks, you start by importing contacts.  

## To import contacts from QuickBooks

1. In [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], on the Home page, choose **Import your contacts**.  
2. In the **Import contacts** dialog, choose **QuickBooks**. Log in to QuickBooks with your QuickBooks account.  

That's it. Your customers and items are now synchronized between [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)] and QuickBooks. When you send an invoice from [!INCLUDE[d365inv](includes/d365inv.md)], it will show up in QuickBooks a few minutes later.  

> [!NOTE]  
> If your list of customers or items is longer than 200 entries, then synchronization with QuickBooks can take a while.
