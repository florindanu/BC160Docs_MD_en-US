# Add Freeze Panes
If you must use the horizontal scroll bar to view all columns on a list page or on document lines, then you can add a vertical freeze pane to restrict some columns from scrolling. You can make sure that only less important columns move and more important columns remain visible and do not move when you scroll.  
  
 You can make multiple customizations of the same page based on different access points to the page. For example, you can customize that Freeze Panes in the **Sales Orders** window look different when the window is opened from the **Customer Card** window than when it is opened from your Role Center. The point from which you access the page to be customized is recorded in that specific page customization. Accordingly, there may be multiple customization records for the same page under your logon, as you can see in the **Delete User Personalization** window.  
  
### To add a freeze pane  
  
1.  Open the shortcut menu for a column header, and then choose **Choose Columns**.  
  
2.  In the list of shown columns, select the column after which you want the freeze pane to start.  
  
3.  Choose **Add Freeze Pane**.  
  
4.  Choose the **OK** button to close the **Customize** window and review the freeze pane positioning.  
  
### To restore default settings  
  
-   In the **Customize** window, choose the **Restore Defaults** button, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  All customization of freeze panes that you have ever made for this page under your current user logon or since you last used the **Restore Defaults** button are canceled. The freeze pane is reset to the default configuration for your profile. For more information, see [Cancel UI Personalization](../how-to-cancel-ui-personalization.md).
