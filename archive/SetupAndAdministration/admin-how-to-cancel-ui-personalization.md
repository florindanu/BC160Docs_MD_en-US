# Cancel UI Personalization
If you want to cancel all UI customization that you have ever made for a page under your current user logon or since you last canceled UI customizations, you can use the **Delete User Personalization** window. The layout of the page for which you delete your personalization is then reset to the default configuration for your profile.  

 If you only want to cancel UI customization that you have made to a specific UI area on a page, such as the ribbon, you can use the **Restore Defaults** button in the **Customize** window. The layout of the specific UI area on that page is then reset to the default configuration for your profile.  

### To cancel all UI customization that you have made to a page  

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Delete User Personalization**, and then choose the related link.  

2.  Select the page for which you want to cancel your UI customization, and then choose the **Delete** action.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  All UI customization of the page that you have ever made under your current user logon or since you last used the **Delete User Personalization** window are canceled. The layout of the page is reset to the default configuration for your profile, as configured by the administrator or as installed with Microsoft Dynamics NAV.  

## To cancel UI customization that you have made to a UI area on a page  

1.  From the page where you have customized a UI area, such as the ribbon, on the **Application** menu ![Application Menu button in menu bar](../media/applicationmenuicon.png "ApplicationMenuIcon"), choose **Customize**, and then choose **Customize <UI area>**.  
2.  At the bottom of the **Customize** window, choose the **Restore Defaults** button.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  All customization of the UI area that you have ever made for the page under your current user logon or since you last used the **Restore Defaults** button are canceled. The layout of the UI area on the page is reset to the default configuration for your profile, as configured by the administrator or as installed with Microsoft Dynamics NAV.
