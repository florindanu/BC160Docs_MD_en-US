# Add Department Links to the Role Center
Sometimes you may find a link on a **Departments** page that you want to add to your Role Center. The link can appear in one of the following menus:  
  
-   The **Home** menu on the ribbon on your Role Center.  
  
-   The **Actions** menu on the ribbon on your Role Center  
  
-   The **Reports** menu on the ribbon on your Role Center  
  
 The following table describes the types of links in each category on the **Departments** pages, and where on your Role Center you can add them.  
  
|**Category**|**Contains**|**Add link to**|  
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|  
|Lists|List pages|**Home** menu|  
|Tasks|Task pages, batch jobs, worksheets, journals|**Actions** menu|  
|Reports and Analysis|Reports, batch jobs, matrix windows|**Reports** menu|  
|Documents|Documents such as invoices and reminders|**Reports** menu|  
|History|Posted/finished documents, registers|**Actions** menu|  
|Administration|Setup windows|**Actions** menu|  
  
### To copy department links to your role center  
  
1.  Choose the **Departments** menu button and locate the link on a **Departments** page.  
  
2.  In the shortcut menu on the link choose one of the following (only one of these options will be available).  
  
    |**Select**|**To add the link to**|  
    |----------------|----------------------------|  
    |**Add to Navigation Pane**|The **Home** menu on the ribbon on your Role Center.|  
    |**Add to Actions on Role Center Ribbon**|The **Actions** menu on the ribbon on your Role Center|  
    |**Add to Reports on Role Center Ribbon**|The **Reports** menu on the ribbon on your Role Center|  
  
3.  Confirm the message that appears.  
  
 The new link now appears in the menu to which you added it. However, you may want to move the link to another position in the menu. For example, if you added a link to the navigation pane, it will appear on the **Home** menu, but you can move it to another menu in the navigation pane.
