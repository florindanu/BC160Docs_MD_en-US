# Customize the Navigation Pane
You can customize the navigation pane with the **Customize Navigation Pane** window.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Depending on the setting in the **UI Elements Removal** field in the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_admin](../../includes/How%20to:%20Specify%20When%20UI%20Elements%20Are%20Removed.md).  
  
### To start customizing the navigation pane window  
  
-   On the **Application** menu ![Microsoft Dynamics NAV Application menu](../media/rtc_applicationmenu.png "RTC_ApplicationMenu"), choose **Customize**, and then choose **Customize Navigation Pane**.  
  
## Renaming or Rearranging Buttons in the Navigation Pane  
 You cannot move, rename, or remove the **Home** button. The **Departments** button can be removed from the navigation pane, but not renamed or moved. However, you can move, rename, or remove other menu buttons in your navigation pane.  
  
#### To move, rename, or remove buttons in the navigation pane  
  
-   In the **Customize Navigation Pane** dialog box, in the left pane, select the button that you want to move, rename, or remove and then choose the relevant button in the middle of the window.  
  
## Creating a New Menu Button  
  
#### To add a new button to your navigation pane  
  
1.  In the **Customize Navigation Pane** dialog box, choose **New** and then type a name in the **Name** field.  
  
2.  Choose the **OK** button.  
  
 Now you can add links to the menu.  
  
## Adding a Link to a Menu in the Navigation Pane  
 If you have permission to view a list, such as the sales order list, you can add a link to the list to one of the menus in your navigation pane.  
  
#### To add a link to a menu  
  
1.  In the **Customize Navigation Pane** dialog box, in the **Navigation pane buttons** field, select the menu that you want to add the link to.  
  
2.  Choose the **Add** button.  
  
3.  Browse to the link that you want to add, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 If you find a link in the **Departments** pages, you can also add it to the navigation pane. For more information, see [Adding a Link from Departments to Your Role Center](../how-to-add-department-links-to-the-role-center.md)  
  
## Moving or Copying a Link from One Menu to Another  
  
#### To move a link from one menu to another  
  
1.  In the **Customize Navigation Pane** dialog box, in the **Navigation pane buttons** field, select the menu where the link currently appears.  
  
2.  In the **Lists** pane, select the link that you want to move, and then choose **Move To** or **Copy To**  
  
3.  Select the menu that you want to add the link to, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
### To rearrange the order of a menu  
  
1.  In the **Lists** pane, select the link that you want to move.  
  
2.  Use the **Move Up** and **Move Down** buttons to position the link.  
  
## Restoring Default Settings  
 If you want to cancel all the changes that you have made (and saved) to the navigation pane, you can do this in the **Customize Navigation Pane** dialog box. All the customization of the navigation pane that you have ever made under your current user logon or since you last used the **Restore Defaults** button are canceled. The navigation pane is reset to the default configuration for your profile. For more information, see [Cancel UI Personalization](../how-to-cancel-ui-personalization.md).  
  
#### To restore default settings  
  
-   In the **Customize** window, choose **Restore Defaults** and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
 Your changes will appear in the navigation pane when you restart [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)].
