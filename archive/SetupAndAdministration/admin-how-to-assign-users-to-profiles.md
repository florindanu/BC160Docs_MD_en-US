# Assign Users to Profiles
Be sure that the users you add to a profile have roles (that is, database permissions) that are consistent with the Role Center that is linked with the profile.  
  
 This task must be completed by an administrator.  
  
### To assign a user to a profile  
  
1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **User Personalization**, and then choose the related link.  
  
2.  In the **User Personalization Card**, select the **Profile ID** list, and select a profile.  
  
     You can also update the **Language ID** or **Company** field at this point.  
  
3.  Choose **OK**.  
  
 All users not explicitly assigned to a profile see the default profile when they start the RoleTailored client.
