# Manage Profiles
You use profiles to link Role Centers to users. Like Role Centers, profiles align with the roles and responsibilities in your organization. [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] provides a set of default profiles, which each correspond to and link to a Role Center. Administrators can modify existing profiles or create new ones.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Profiles are not explicitly linked to the roles and permissions that constitute the security system, but profile users must have permissions that align with their roles in the security system. For more information, see [Security in the Role Tailored Environment](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=147633) in the MSDN Library.
