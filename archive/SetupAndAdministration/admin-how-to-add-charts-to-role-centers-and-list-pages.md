# Add Charts to Role Centers and List Pages
When you have complex information, you may want to view a visual representation of the data to help see trends and make decisions. For example, you may want to monitor the balances per bank account for your company in a chart.  
  
 You use the chart pane to visually show data from a list on the following types of pages:  
  
-   On your Role Center, where you can select from predefined generic charts.  
  
-   On a list page, where you can select to view a list as a chart.  
  
### To add a generic chart to your Role Center  
  
1.  On your Role Center, on the **Application** menu ![Microsoft Dynamics NAV Application menu](../media/rtc_applicationmenu.png "RTC_ApplicationMenu"), select **Customize**, and then **Customize this Page**.  
  
2.  In the **Customize the Role Center** window, in the **Available parts** field, select **Chart Part**, and then choose **Add**.  
  
3.  Use the **Move Up**, **Move Down**, **Move Left**, and **Move Right** buttons to position the Chart Part on your Role Center.  
  
4.  Choose **Customize Part**.  
  
5.  In the **Customize Chart** window, select the predefined chart that you want to display, and then choose the **OK** button.  
  
### To view a list as a chart  
  
1.  On the list page, select **Show as Chart**.  
  
2.  Select a measure and a dimension to create a custom chart. To see additional information, select a secondary dimension. For example, to create a simple bar chart, select a dimension on the x-axis, and then select the **Dimension Count** dimension on the y-axis.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  By default, the chart pane is hidden because it can slow down performance. You should only show the chart when you must have the information.
