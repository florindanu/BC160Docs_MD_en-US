# Customize the User Interface
The concept of user interface (UI) customization in [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] is divided in two:  
  
-   Configuration, which is performed by the administrator  
  
-   Personalization, which performed by users  
  
 The administrator configures the user interface for multiple users by customizing the user interface for a profile that the users are assigned to.  
  
 Users personalize the user interface of their personal version of the profile by customizing the user interface under their own user logon.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Only the ADD INCLUDE<!--[!INCLUDE[nav_windows](../../includes/nav_windows_md.md)]--> as configuration are reflected in the web client.  
  
 The following table describes a sequence of tasks, with links to the topics that describe them.   
  
|**To**|**See**|  
|------------|-------------|  
|As an administrator, remove UI elements according to permissions. Then, configure different profile-specific page layouts using the same UI customization functions that users use.|[Configure the User Interface](../configure-the-user-interface.md)|  
|As a user, change how actions, fields, and page parts are placed in your personal version of [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] using a rich set of UI customization functions.|PERSONALIZATION Personalize the User Interface|
