# Troubleshooting: Removing Promoted Actions in Home Tab
In [!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] removing a promoted action in the Home tab, and then re-adding it in the same session will cause duplication of the action.  
  
## Resolution  
 Remove the action, apply changes, add the action again, and then apply changes. Or, remove the action, add it again in same session, and then apply changes. Remove duplicate instances and apply changes.
